gnome-shell-extension-sensors
=============================
*gnome-shell-extension-sensors* (previously known as gnome-shell-extension-cpu-temperature)
is an extension for displaying CPU temperature, hard disk temperature, voltage and
CPU fan RPM in GNOME Shell.

The extension uses [sensors] from lm_sensors package (lm-sensors for Debian systems)
to read temperature for different CPU cores and adapters, voltage data and fan speed.

Optionally, this extension uses the [UDisks2] dbus interface or [hddtemp] as fallback to
read hard drive temperature data.

Installation
=============

This is the **recommended method** for installation, as it doesn't require the build

Fedora has packaged a **very old** version of this extension. You can install it by running:

`yum -y install gnome-shell-extension-cpu-temperature`

However this package will be retired and possibly replaced in the future according to Bug [RH#983409].

    cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/xtranophilist/gnome-shell-extension-sensors.git
    cd ~/gnome-shell-extension-sensors
    ./autogen.sh

To build the extension for gnome-shell 3.8 or older please run the following commands:

    cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/xtranophilist/gnome-shell-extension-sensors.git
    cd ~/gnome-shell-extension-sensors
    git checkout gnome-3.8

* Enter `r` to restart the GNOME shell

Then enable the extension:
Open `gnome-tweak-tool` -> `Shell Extensions` -> `Sensors` -> On


Installing dependencies
-------------
Installing lm-sensors for Fedora, CentOS and other distros with yum:

`yum install -y lm_sensors`

Ubuntu, Debian and other distros with apt-get:

`apt-get install lm-sensors`

Then run `sensors-detect` as root as one time detection process.

Installing `hdd-temp`:

`yum -y install hddtemp`


Configuration
---------------------

This extensions uses the output of `sensors`(1) command to obtain the
temperature data and sensor labeling. To relabel, hide or correct the
output consult the `sensors.conf`(5) manual.
